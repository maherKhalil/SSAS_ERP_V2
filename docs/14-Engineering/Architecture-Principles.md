# Architecture Principles

## Purpose

This document defines the mandatory architectural principles governing the design and implementation of SSAS ERP V2.

Unlike Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), which explain *why* architectural decisions were made, this document specifies *how* all developers and AI coding agents must implement the system consistently.

These principles are mandatory for every module, service, and feature.

---

# Guiding Principles

The architecture shall prioritize:

- Maintainability
- Scalability
- Modularity
- Security
- Testability
- Performance
- Simplicity
- Consistency
- AI-assisted development

---

# Principle 1 – Modular Monolith

The application shall be implemented as a Modular Monolith.

Modules communicate through well-defined contracts and shall not access each other's internal implementation.

Reference: ADR-001

---

# Principle 2 – Clean Architecture

Dependencies always point inward.

```
Presentation
    ↓
Application
    ↓
Domain
    ↑
Infrastructure
```

The Domain layer must not depend on any external framework.

Reference: ADR-003

---

# Principle 3 – CQRS

Commands modify state.

Queries return data.

A request shall never perform both responsibilities simultaneously.

Reference: ADR-004

---

# Principle 4 – Multi-Tenant by Default

Every business operation executes within a tenant context.

Every tenant-owned entity shall include `TenantId`.

Cross-tenant access is prohibited unless explicitly approved.

Reference: ADR-005

---

# Principle 5 – Security First

Authentication uses JWT Bearer Tokens.

Authorization is claims- and permission-based.

Never trust client-provided identity or authorization data.

Reference: ADR-006

---

# Principle 6 – Angular Frontend

All web user interfaces shall use Angular.

Business logic belongs in backend services, not Angular components.

Reference: ADR-007

---

# Principle 7 – Entity Framework Core

EF Core is the standard ORM.

Use Fluent API configuration.

Use migrations for schema evolution.

Avoid Lazy Loading.

Reference: ADR-008

---

# Principle 8 – Domain Events

Modules communicate through Domain Events.

Events represent completed business facts.

Publish events only after successful transaction commits.

Reference: ADR-009

---

# Principle 9 – Repository Pattern

Repositories encapsulate persistence for aggregate roots.

Business logic shall never exist inside repositories.

Reference: ADR-010

---

# Principle 10 – Unit of Work

Every request executes within a single Unit of Work.

Transactions are committed once.

Domain Events are published after a successful commit.

Reference: ADR-011

---

# General Rules

Developers and AI coding agents shall:

- Keep controllers thin.
- Keep business logic in Application and Domain layers.
- Never bypass tenant isolation.
- Never inject DbContext into controllers.
- Never expose entities directly through APIs.
- Always use DTOs.
- Use asynchronous APIs where supported.
- Prefer constructor injection.
- Keep classes focused and cohesive.

---

# Naming Conventions

- One class per file.
- One public type per file.
- PascalCase for types.
- camelCase for local variables.
- Feature-first folder structure.
- One repository per aggregate.
- One handler per command or query.

---

# Dependency Rules

Allowed dependencies:

- Presentation → Application
- Application → Domain
- Infrastructure → Application
- Infrastructure → Domain

Forbidden dependencies:

- Domain → Infrastructure
- Domain → Presentation
- Application → Presentation

---

## Composition Root Exception

SSAS.Host.API may reference approved Platform, HR, and GL API and Infrastructure projects solely for dependency injection, configuration, middleware coordination, and endpoint mapping. This exception does not permit business logic in the Host. Module API projects must not reference Infrastructure. Module Application and Domain projects must not reference Host or Infrastructure. Cross-module business communication must use approved public contracts, integration events, or explicitly authorized module-facing abstractions. Direct references to another module's internal Domain, Application, API, or Infrastructure assemblies are forbidden.

---

# AI Coding Guidelines

AI coding agents shall:

- Follow all ADRs.
- Never introduce architectural shortcuts.
- Preserve module boundaries.
- Reuse shared abstractions.
- Generate tests for new functionality.
- Document public APIs.
- Respect coding standards.
- Avoid duplicate implementations.

---

# Code Review Checklist

Every pull request should verify:

- Architecture compliance.
- Tenant isolation.
- Authorization checks.
- Unit tests.
- Naming conventions.
- Logging.
- Error handling.
- Performance considerations.
- Documentation updates.

---

# Exceptions

Any deviation from these principles requires approval from the Solution Architect and, where appropriate, a new ADR documenting the change.
